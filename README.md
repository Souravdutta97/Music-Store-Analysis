# Music-Store-Analysis
## overview
This is project I came to know from one of the linkdIn comment so I decided to solve this and generate insight from this data set. I was tasked with helping the Chinook team understand the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

I was given the database which I loaded into DB SQL SERVER to conduct the Analysis.

I will take you through the processes I took in answering the business questions and the insights generated.
